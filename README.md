# StarFive VisionFive2 (JH7110) Flashloader

This is a flashloader binary crate for use with the [`probe-rs`](https://github.com/probe-rs/probe-rs).

The `QSPI` driver is based on the work in the [`Linux driver for cadence-quadspi`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/drivers/spi/spi-cadence-quadspi.c).

**WARNING** The crate is in the earliest stages of development, and is still undergoing testing against real hardware.
